Backups are saved in the `backups/mysql` directory and uploaded to your configured Google Cloud Storage bucket if selected.

```bash
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/your/service-account.json
GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-access-key
